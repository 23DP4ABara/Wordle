# Wordle

The project's name is **Wordle**, which is a game with a goal to guess a word, you have only 6 tries, when you enter a word the program checks if the word exists in the dictionary txt file, then it checks if the characters that are typed in exist in the hidden word, in case they do it checks if they are in the right place, if they are, the character lights up green, if they aren't it lights up yellow and if there is no such character in the word, it stays the same color. To start playing you need to press the Start button, which takes one random 5 letter word from the txt file and returns it as the hidden word.
